# EAFC-Price-Alerts
In this code, I build a bot that tracks the prices of common players in the virtual football simulation EAFC26 by connecting to the API of futgg.com. Further, I built an alert to a discord server using a discord webhook that signals whenever a player's price falls below a certain threshold for optimal pricing decisions.
